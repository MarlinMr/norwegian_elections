**Cycle:** every 4 years.

**Method:** [Sainte-Laguë method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method). Paper ballots. ID required. Counted 2 times locally, one of which has to be manuall, then a 3rd time with the rest of the constituency. 

Stortinget (The Parlament) is the highest authority in Norway. The Monarch is responsible to form a government. Stortinget does not form a government, but can vote to have the Monarch, government or any minister removed or replaced.^5 MPs cannot also be Ministers and their place in Stortinget is taken by the next on the list while they serve as Ministers.

**Voting population**: 3'876'200 people. [1'645'913 has pre-voted](https://www.valg.no/aktuelt/siste-nytt/sa-mange-har-stemt/), 42.34%^4  

**Timeline**: 
Early-voting until August 10th. 8'469 early-votes were cast. 

Pre-voting can be done between 10th August and last Friday before election day. This can be done anywhere. On election day, you can only vote in your home municipality. 172 of 426 (2017 numbers) municipalities open voting Sunday September 10th. All municipalities open for voting Monday September 11th. By law, election day is a day in September. By law, the Monarch selects election day on a Monday. Local municipality government can allow voting to start on the Sunday before, not instead of Monday. Special laws apply outside mainland Norway. 

**Electoral threshold**:

The Norwegians elect 169 representatives for Stortinget. 150 are selected directly, the last 19 are Utgjevningsmandater (Leveling seat/Ausgleichsmandat), one from [each constituency](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Norway_counties.svg/957px-Norway_counties.svg.png)^1 . **To get a leveling seat, a party must have more than 4.0% total votes.** This year, there are 4 parties that can all go on either side of the 4.0%, and will have huge inpact on the final result. [Informal video from NRK (Norwegian BBC) with English subs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw-U-JOCu6I).

It is important to note that there also is a Sami parliamentary election the same day. Only Sami people can vote. The Sami people can vote in both elections.

###2017 election and current parlament

[The current Storting](https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/stortinget-undervisning---besokssider/840/salkart-stortinget-2017-21-med-antall-mandater-840x450.jpg) was elected in 2017, with 78.2% voting participation. Maintaining a weak block lead of the right block (**H**, **FRP**, **KRF**, **V**) of 88 MPs. This is was down from 96 in 2013. 85 MPs are needed for a majority. Because of the new lower number of MPs, and **V** was able to force their way into government positions in 2018. **KRF** had a national conference where they questioned if they should stop supporting the right block government, and force a change in government in late 2018. They ended up choosing the right block, against the will of the party leader, who step down because of that. This gave a ***H***, ***FRP***, ***V***, ***KRF*** government in early 2019, first right wing majority government since 1985. However, this only lasted until early 2020, when **FRP** left the government over the decision to bring female Norwegian ISIS terrorists and their children home. It can also be speculated that they left government to position themselvs as opposition party for the 2021 election. **H**, **V**, **KRF** has reigned since with only 61 MPs. Normally that would be considered a weak government, but because of the pandemic it has arguably been easier to govern as major decisions has often been mandated by medical authorities.

[Wiki polling graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Norwegian_Opinion_Polling%2C_30_Day_Moving_Average%2C_2013-2017.png)

**Notable trends**:

* Neither the right [(**H**, **FRP**)](https://i.imgur.com/UJcbpYo.png), nor the left [(**AP**, **Rødt**, **SV**)](https://i.imgur.com/Q6zAjFI.png) has been polling a clear lead. Both are dependant on support from the center [(**SP**, **MDG**, **KRF**, **V**)](https://i.imgur.com/hlZOf3W.png), giving a lot of power to the smaller parties. The left wing coalition of **AP**, **SV**, **SP** had a majority vote from 2005 until 2013. This is however unlikely today. 

* [**AP** (Labour)](https://i.imgur.com/WHEJHo6.png) is polling worse than last election. Not since 1924 has their numbers been this low, loosing as much as 5% from last election. Much is blamed on [Jonas Gahr Støre](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Jonas_Gahr_St%C3%B8re_%28174630%29.jpg), current party leader, [who comes of as "elitist".](http://kampanje.com/pr/2017/09/erna-knuser-jonas-pa-folkelighet/)

* [**SP**](https://i.imgur.com/HLprjai.png) has notably increased their voter base, doubling since 2013 going from 5.5% to >10%. **SP** is supporting **AP**, and was in government with **AP** and **SV** before the 2013 election.

* [**Rødt**](https://i.imgur.com/fZxRMXC.png) is polling better than ever, however ties to Marxism is making **AP** refuse to cooperate in forming a government. It is likely that they will have their first MP after this election. Their leader is often compared to Bernie Sanders, and the US election might play a part in recent numbers. It is worth noting that Norway is politically left, meaning that Sanders could fit in anywhere from left to right, and does not have to be compared to the Norwegian far left. 

* **MDG** has grown steadily since last election, and is now [polling over 4.0%.](https://i.imgur.com/qSckJoM.png) This will significantly increase the number of MPs. **SV** got 7 MPs with 4.1% in 2013. Combined with "weak" numbers on both the right and the left, **MDG** will most likely be in a position where any government will need their support. As the party has no clear affiliation to any side, environmental policies will play a big role the next 4 years. [Possible left wing coalition](https://i.imgur.com/bCJKI5p.png). [Possible right wind coalition](https://i.imgur.com/DQgduIL.png).

* [**KRF**](https://i.imgur.com/HPCQ9b2.png) has been stable since 2005. With 10 to 11 MPs. Even though they are polling at 1% less than 2013, they could see an +1 increase in MPs at current polling. They are currently supporting the right wing government. It is not possible that a right wing government can be formed without their support. It is not clear who they will support in a new parlament, but their vote will be deciding. 

* [**Venstre**](https://i.imgur.com/bAW1Kiq.png), listerally translated to "Left", is currently supporting the right wing government. However they are at below 4.0%. Current polling show a -8 in number of MPs. Leaving only 1 MP. And this is just a -1.7% change since 2013, showing just how important the 4.0% mark is. 

* **Høyre (H)**, literally translated to "Right", and **FRP** are showing numbers a bit stronger than the 2013 election. They are currently in government, supported by, and dependent on, **KRF** and **V**. There is a general satisfaction with the government. When **FRP** was elected in 2013, Norway was criticized for electing a right wing party. **FRP** was compared to Front National (**FN**) and the leader, [Siv Jensen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/SivJensen2361_2E_jpg_DF0000062813.jpg) was compared to Marine Le Pen. This however is not at all the case. The Norwegian right is in the centre compared to many EU countries, and might be considered Left in the US. Jean-Marie Le Pen said **FRP** and **FN** had several common policies in 1997. Then leader of **FRP** [Carl I. Hagen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/CI_Hagen2326_2E_jpg_DF0000062800.jpg) denied this several times.

**Probable cause of events**:

* **Venstre** does not go below the 4.0% mark, and maintain the number of MPs. Polling does not show significant change for **KRF**, **H** or **FRP**, which will maintain current MP numbers and the government stays as it is. The right wing continues for 4 more years. This is not an unlikely scenario.

* **Venstre** does go below the 4.0% mark. [The current right government](https://i.imgur.com/drUEu77.png) might have just barely a majority. A Motion of Confidence will be put forth by **AP** leader Støre, since [the left does not have a majority](https://i.imgur.com/xuCGaKo.png). Even though **KRF** is supporting the current government, they will now be able to choose any government they want. Currently they are supporting the right wing government, but does not have any minister positions. **AP** voters do not want **KRF** in government, but with such a weak right, anything could happen. This is also a likely scenario, but what kind of government arises from it, is unclear. 

* **AP**, **SV**, **SP** get a majority vote, with 85+ MPs. They will go back into government as they did in 2013. However with weak numbers for **AP**, it is unlikely they will be able to do this alone. Even though **SP** are polling strong, enough MPs will be given to [**MDG** and **Rødt**](https://i.imgur.com/xuCGaKo.png) to make them important. It is not unlikely that **MDG** will cooperate. And one would expect that **Rødt**, which is the party furthest to the left, would go all in to take down a right wing government. However **Rødt** refuse to help the rest of the left unless the law regarding how kindergartens can be run is changed. This means even one MP for **Rødt** could put a lot of pressure on the left. And the current ice-front between **Rødt** and **AP** could stop them from forming a government. 

**TL;DR**:

The election is extremely open. Only small differences in voting will decide between a right wing or left wing government. All polling indicates that the support of the center parties **MDG** (Green Party), **KRF** (Christian Democratic Party) and **V** (Liberal Party) will be the deciding factor. Polling also indicates **V** will lose almost all MPs, giving the projected 18 MPs from **MDG** and **KRF** a lot of power. Solberg will continue as PM, or Støre will become the new PM. There is no notable "extreme right" movement, however there is a notable increase in "extreme left" with **Rødt**.

###Some topics

* **Oil export/Climate**: 59% of the economy is directly linked petroleum export. All major parties acknowledge climate change, and the fact that we have to reduce emissions. Energy in Norway has been almost 100% renewable the last 100 years, and the issue is about how fast we are going to close down the oil wells and if we should [stop further searching and development of oil fields](https://i.imgur.com/Ny8hskG.jpg). **KRF** is conflicted. [Everyone agrees we stop sale of new petrol cars before 2025.](https://i.imgur.com/veDMElU.jpg) **FRP** is conflicted. **MDG** (Green Party) is projected to see a 600% MP increase. Some parties are defending oil/gass production by saying it stops even more polluting coal production on mainland Europe. Others defend it simply because of jobs and economy.

* **District policies**: The current Government has reduced number of police districts and centralized the police force. Parlament has voted to reduce number of municipalities from 426 to 354, and the Government also want to reduce the number of Counties from 19 to 11. The Armed Forces suggested a reduced standing force and closing of many bases, if funding was not increased. And the current Government is positive to larger farms. All these factors concentrate jobs and mostly affects those living in rural areas. This has all accumulated in **SP** geting a much stronger voter base. Their cause is to fight for people living in the districts, farmers and rural communities. 

* **Defence policies**: As mentioned, the Armed Forces need more money, or must close bases and reduce standing force. The hottest part of this debate is about the Orion base on Andøya. It is currently being moved 100km south. Another hot topic is the Army helicopters in Bardufoss. Currently they are also being moved. Everyone say they want to "increase defence capabilities", but no one is going to spend significantly more than others. Of course no one would want to reduce capabilities. The Armed Forces really do as they see fit with the money they get. The right wants to continue to do, as advised by the Admiral, and centralize more.  The opposition wants to slow a bit down and wait for the up and coming report about the Army and Home Guard. **AP** also think they have a solution that lets the Army keep those helicopters. **SV**, **Rødt**, and **MDG** want to reduce, freeze or stop the buying of new F-35. 

* **Work**: As anywhere else, the right want to liberalise work laws. To reduce financial support, particularly for farming. To make it easier to hire part time workers. To allow fishers not to deliver fish to local fish landings. To reduce federal ownership in companies. To lower taxes. The left wants the opposite, of course. But this is standard and not really specific to this election. It is worth noting that Norway is really left on all these issues from before. The current government has already opened for Sunday shopping. (Yes, most stores are closed on Sundays in Norway, and alcohol is hard to come by on certain days). What is new this election cycle is **Rødt** and **SV** pushing for a 6 hour work day. This is quite new, but is coming in full force. Even the biggest union, with 340 000 members, is starting to push this. It will probably be the norm in 5-10 years. **AP** is not yet on board.

###Footnotes

1: The 13th constituency does not exist, as it was absorbed into number 12. Votes from people on Svalbard are counted based on their personal connection to the mainland.

2: MDG does not want to be placed on either side of the map, but are willing to work with anyone who votes for the environment.

3: Rødt are currently polling at over 3% and are expected to get seats in Parlament. 

4: As of August 30th.

5: Stortinget was given the right to throw governments by the constitution in 2007. Before this, it was only customary. A Motion of Confidence is often used, particularly against specific ministers, but is seldom given a majority vote. Most notably Stortinget threw the government in 1928 and 1963. In 1905, no party were willing to form a government. As a result, [Stortinget concluded](https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/stortingsarkivet/135_403.06_19050607_manus_berner_pdf.pdf) that the Swedish King Oscar II had not done his duty as King and thus was no longer King of Norway.

6: This seems to be disputed here. They are a Norwegian right-wing party, but are more center on a global stage.
